# 🌦 Weather & Air Quality Dashboard (Power BI + API Integration + Figma)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is an **interactive Power BI dashboard** that integrates **real-time weather and air quality data** for major Indian cities.  
The dashboard provides **city-wise comparisons, 7-day forecasts and AQI insights**, enabling users to track climate trends and pollution risks effectively.  

Prototype was first designed in **Figma**, then developed in **Power BI** with **live API integration, DAX calculations and data modeling**.
